    <h1 class="mb-4">IT / Data Security Concept</h1>
    
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Authentication and User-Access Management</h2>
        <p>Summary: To counteract unauthorized access and safeguard sensitive information, we employ comprehensive authentication and user access management protocols. Utilizing OpenVPN or Wireguard ensures secure network connections by establishing encrypted tunnels, which are critical for protecting data in transit against interception or eavesdropping. For secure data storage, we use LUKS for SSD encryption, which guards against data theft by making the information inaccessible without the correct passphrase. Additionally, NFC technology is implemented for user authentication, providing a seamless yet secure method for verifying user identity, significantly reducing the risk of credential theft or unauthorized access.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">Study Center Laptop</h2>
        <p>Scope: The study center laptop serves as a crucial interface for researchers, designed to handle sensitive healthcare information with the utmost security. By processing data temporarily and preventing permanent storage, we mitigate the risk of long-term data exposure. The use of study-specific software on these laptops ensures that only necessary data is processed and that it is done within a controlled environment, minimizing the chances of data leakage or unauthorized access.</p>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Network Configuration</h2>
        <p>Summary: Our network's security infrastructure is fortified with OpenVPN and Wireguard, each offering distinct advantages in creating a secure and resilient networking environment. OpenVPN's use of TA, SSL, and ed25519 certificates with passphrases presents a multi-layered defense against network-based attacks, ensuring that all data transmission is robustly encrypted. Wireguard offers a streamlined yet powerful alternative, designed for ease of configuration without compromising security, ideal for adapting to diverse hospital IT requirements. This meticulous network configuration is essential for protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data as it moves across networks, effectively shielding against unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks.</p>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-3">SSD Encryption</h2>
        <p>Summary: Implementing SSD encryption via LUKS is a cornerstone of our strategy to protect data at rest. This approach ensures that if a device were to be lost or stolen, the data it contains would remain encrypted and inaccessible without the correct authentication key. By requiring password authentication, we add an additional layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches. Regular data cleanup routines further enhance our security posture by ensuring that sensitive information is not inadvertently stored longer than necessary, thus minimizing exposure to potential data theft or unauthorized access.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">Users</h2>
        <div class="mb-3">
            <h3>Root / Agl-admin</h3>
            <p>Summary: Root users, equipped with full system privileges, are a critical component of our security and recovery processes. By employing NFC tags for authentication, we provide a secure and efficient method for these users to access the system, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized entry. This role is tightly controlled, with rigorous measures in place for key storage and access, ensuring that the system's core functionalities are guarded against exploitation and unauthorized changes.</p>

        <div class="mb-3">
            <h3>Center User</h3>
            <p>Summary: Center users are at the forefront of our system's interaction, processing sensitive data through the system UI. NFC authentication for these users ensures a high level of security, minimizing the risk of unauthorized data access. By closely monitoring their activities, we can prevent the mishandling of sensitive information and ensure that data processing complies with our strict security standards.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Maintenance User</h3>
            <p>Summary: Maintenance users play a vital role in the upkeep of our system, granted access only to necessary functions for system maintenance. Authentication through NFC tags and ed25519 IDs provides a secure and controlled entry point, ensuring that these users cannot access sensitive data. This role is specifically designed to maintain the integrity of the system without compromising the security of the data it contains.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">Study Data HDD</h2>
        <p>Summary: The Study Data HDD is entrusted with the long-term storage of research data, operating under stringent data storage policies. By automating the pseudonymization of raw data, we significantly reduce the risk associated with manual data handling and ensure that sensitive information is anonymized effectively. This data is stored temporarily until verification, limiting exposure and enhancing data security. Our approach to data storage is designed with the flexibility to accommodate participant consent withdrawal and data re-integration, ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines and regulatory standards.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Our IT/Data Security concept represents a comprehensive strategy to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of study data. By integrating advanced encryption technologies, secure network configurations, and stringent user access controls, we create a robust defense against various security threats. This multifaceted approach not only ensures the safety of sensitive information but also bolsters our research objectives, allowing us to conduct our work ethically, responsibly, and in full compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
